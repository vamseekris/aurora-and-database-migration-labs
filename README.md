## Current Labs

[Aurora MySQL](https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-and-database-migration-labs/blob/master/Labs/Aurora%20MySQL/Aurora%20MySQL%20Hands%20On%20Lab%20Manual%202.1.pdf) - In this lab you will create Aurora MySQL DB Cluster, modify security group to allow access to the Aurora MySQL DB instance from your computer, load data from S3 into Aurora MySQL database, create read replica instance & access table, create a database copy using Aurora "Clone" feature, and perform DML query on primary DB and validate data on primary and cloned DB copy.

[Aurora MySQL Serverless](https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-and-database-migration-labs/blob/master/Labs/Aurora%20MySQL/Amazon%20Aurora%20Serverless%20for%20MySQL%20Lab.pdf) - In this lab you will create and configure a new Aurora Serverless DB cluster, create a Cloud9 client environment and then enable network traffic to the Aurora Serverless cluster from your Cloud9 environment, setup sysbench on the Cloud9 environment and run load test using the provided script, clean up and terminate your Cloud9 environment and Aurora Serverless DB cluster.

[Aurora MySQL Serverless Data API Live Demo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aurora-and-database-migration-labs/blob/master/Labs/Aurora%20MySQL/Aurora%20MySQL%20Serverless%20Data%20API%20Live%20Demo.pdf) - In this demo you will setup an Amazon Pinpoint project, configure a long code with 2 way SMS enabled; setup networking infrastructure, Aurora MySQL Serverless cluster and bootstrap the database using AWS Lambda; enable Data API for Aurora serverless cluster. You will use AWS Cloudformation to setup most of the components. Finally you will use the provisioned long code to send your vote and receive survery confirmation.
